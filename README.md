# FollowBlackLine
A script that allows a pi-car to follow the edge of a black line utilizing the line sensors.

--- Optimize values (speed and angle) as needed due to different course shapes! ---

1: Place pi-car inside a maze/course outline with fully black tape, etc

2: Pi-car will find the black line and follow it

3: Pi-car will keep following the black line untill execution is stopped

Thanks to Alex @ DSU for assisting with tweaking and overcoming when the pi-car reads a "wall"
